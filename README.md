# Periodic table of elements
Periodic table of chemical elements in scalable vector graphics format
## Purpose of creation
The purpose of creating this table was the need to create a periodic table of elements in high quality, suitable for printing in high resolution and also containing all the necessary data for studying the periodic law.
## Features
* The table is distributed in svg, pdf and png formats, in color and grayscale versions. In the grayscale version, there is no division of the elements into classes and boiling points and melting points by colors.
* The radius of the atom is shown as a circle of relative size from the corner of the cell of the element. You can immediately see the contraction of radiuses in periods and growth in groups of elements.
* Electronegativity of the elements.
* Filling of atomic orbitals and the electronic configuration of atoms.
* The degree of oxidation of each element is shown, and the most characteristic are shown in bold. This allows correlation of the properties of elements with the structure of their electronic shells.
* The melting points, boiling points, and density of elements (in the center of the cell) are given, and their periodic variation is evident.
* IUPAC switched to a new system for the designation of atomic weights, in which the averaged atomic weight of a natural mixture of isotopes is given, and the boundaries of the isotopic composition of elements in nature. This was done because the isotopic composition of many elements is not constant on the planet and depends on the place and method of production. We tried to switch to this system.
## Cooperation
We gladly accept ideas for improving and processing the appearance of the table. Write to [m@ctable.ru](mailto:m@ctable.ru).
